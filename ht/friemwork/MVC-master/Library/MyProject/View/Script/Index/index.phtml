<h2>Hello from the Index/Index View Script!</h2>

<p class="success">Since you are seeing this your MVC is setup correctly - congratulations!</p>

<p>Just a recap to remind you that you can change this Layout in the <code>/Library/MyProject/Layout/default.phtml</code> file, edit Controllers in the <code>/Library/MyProject/Controller/</code> directory, and View Scripts in the <code>/Library/MyProject/View/Script/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
